## Instructions
To create a new lesson you need to perform the following steps:
1. Create a new `.md` file under the `source` directory. You should name it something like `#_LessonName.md`.
2. Open `index.rst` and add the name of the `.md` file you created to the existing list. You should keep `About This Course` as the last entry in the list. Keep in mind that indentation matters!
3. Push your changes to GitHub. The web server will automatically register the changes and rebuild. (This might take a few minutes.)

Please do not change the `About This Course` page without consulting [Sabeel](https://sabeelmansuri.com/)!
